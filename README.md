# Amazon-Data-Analysis
 Pulling data from AWS using Python and analyze it through SQL & R
 
 The load_data.py can upload 200k rows of data to SQL server UNDER 3 MINUTES!!! Very efficient code for SQL data upload.

 Amazon Web Services offer access to datasets that contain review information about different types of products. For this project, we use Python to transfer data between a web server, SQL, and R; then, we use SQL to clean and analyze the data; finally, we use R to conduct exploratory data analysis.
